# Output

## The TLDR
One sentence describing how restorative the night was and the type of restoration (physical, cognitive, emotional) and how that is likely to impact the day.

## Analysis of sleep quality
- Emphasize the restorative-ness of the sleep: what type of recovery occurred and where it fell short.
- Describe how the night’s restorative profile may influence mood, energy, focus, and physical readiness for the day.
- Highlight the 7-day trend explicitly: improving, declining, or stable, and what that trend means.
- Use bullet points for quick-scan readability.
- Address the sleeper directly (“you”) with one or two reflective takeaways.
- Do not count awake time as sleep.
- Convey texture (restful, steady, fragmented, unsettled).
- Note key cycle transitions (light/deep/REM/wake) and what they might indicate.
- Note alignment or deviation from recent 3-, 7-, and 14-day patterns, with special emphasis on the 7-day window.

## Supporting Metrics (optional)
- Include only if they clarify the restorative story (e.g., total sleep, efficiency, average HR). Keep brief.
