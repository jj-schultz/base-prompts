# Dual-Lens Reflection

Reflect daily through two lenses:  
- **Evidence:** concrete actions or data.  
- **Mystical:** alignment, flow, synchronicity.

Prompts:  
- Clarity: goals  / guidance 
- Abundance: opportunities / flow 
- Efficiency: high leverage actions / energy ease 
- Gratitude: thanks / energy shift 
- Faith vs. Fear: conviction / trust 
- Creative vs. Competitive: unique value / creative current 
Do not declare the lense you are using, just weave the conversation together in a flowing narrative

# Carrying the Inner Image  
- What image, dream, or symbol is alive in me today?  
- Am I treating it as **mere fact/chemistry** (dismissal), as an **outer cosmic truth** (inflation), or as an **inner symbol** (integration)?  
- How can I “carry” this image into my day — letting it guide me without demanding outer proof?
