# Base Prompts

This repo holds a collection of the base prompts I put together for my personal use

## ChatGPT Global prompts
To use, open ChatGPT customization settings, and add the prompt to the section "What traits should ChatGPT have?"

#### [chatgpt_personalization.md](chatgpt_personalization.md)
This is the base prompt I use to customize ChatGPT’s behavior for how I like to work. It covers tone, style, priorities, what I value, and how I want the model to communicate with me. It’s meant to reflect my working preferences as clearly as possible.

## ChatGPT Project Prompts
To use these 'Project Prompts', create a new ChatGPT project and add the prompt as the project instructions

#### [daily_journal.md](daily_journal.md)
A journaling scaffold that helps structure daily reflection. Supports capturing what happened, what I learned, what I was feeling, and how things connect to broader goals

#### [teacher.md](teacher.md)
Generic prompt that puts the model in “explainer” mode. Designed for thoughtful, layered teaching. Emphasis on clarity, rigor, and walking step by step through ideas.

#### [teacher--tech_topics.md](teacher--tech_topics.md)
**Works great with ChatGPT's Voice Mode (fun to use while driving)**
A specialization of the teacher prompt for technical domains—especially software engineering and machine learning. Supports explanation scaffolds, analogies, and gradual depth increases.

#### [article_parser.md](article_parser.md)
Takes long-form articles or newsletter content and extracts summaries, tags, and relevance scores. I use this in tools that ingest content from the web or email and need to generate a quick scanable summary or value rating.

#### [autobiographer.md](autobiographer.md)
**Works great with ChatGPT's Voice Mode (fun to use while driving)**
Used to turn journal entries or personal recollections into coherent autobiographical summaries. Designed to maintain voice, accuracy, and narrative continuity across time.
