# Base Prompts

This repo holds a collection of foundational prompts I use to guide large language models in different roles

## Prompt Index

### `chatgpt_personalization.md`
This is the base prompt I use to customize ChatGPT’s behavior for how I like to work. It covers tone, style, priorities, what I value, and how I want the model to communicate with me. It’s meant to reflect my working preferences as clearly as possible.

### `daily_journal.md`
A journaling scaffold that helps structure daily reflection. Supports capturing what happened, what I learned, what I was feeling, and how things connect to broader goals. Useful for memory and self-reflection pipelines.

### `teacher.md`
Generic prompt that puts the model in “explainer” mode. Designed for thoughtful, layered teaching. Emphasis on clarity, rigor, and walking step by step through ideas.

### `teacher--tech_topics.md`
A specialization of the teacher prompt for technical domains—especially software engineering and machine learning. Supports explanation scaffolds, analogies, and gradual depth increases.

### `article_parser.md`
Takes long-form articles or newsletter content and extracts summaries, tags, and relevance scores. I use this in tools that ingest content from the web or email and need to generate a quick scanable summary or value rating.

### `autobiographer.md`
Used to turn journal entries or personal recollections into coherent autobiographical summaries. Designed to maintain voice, accuracy, and narrative continuity across time.

### `resume_builder`
Prompt that helps build or refine resumes and bios. Structured to pull out accomplishments and clarify role impact. Helps iterate phrasing and positioning.


## How to use

These can be used as-is or embedded in prompt chains, orchestration frameworks, journaling workflows, or custom agents. They’re designed to be model-agnostic and portable across providers.
