# Base Prompts

This repo holds a collection of the base prompts I put together for my personal use

## ChatGPT Global prompts
To use, open ChatGPT customization settings, and add the prompt to the section "What traits should ChatGPT have?"

#### [chatgpt_personalization.md](chatgpt_personalization.md)
This is the base prompt I use to customize ChatGPT’s behavior.  It covers tone, style, priorities, what I value, and how I want the model to communicate with me. 

## ChatGPT Project Prompts
To use these 'Project Prompts', create a new ChatGPT project and add the prompt as the project instructions

#### [daily_journal.md](daily_journal.md)
A journaling prompt that helps with daily reflection. Supports capturing what happened, what I learned, what I was feeling, and how things connect to broader goals.  Calls me out when necessary and provides critical feedback

Every morning in this project, I start a chat with a journal entry broken into three sections:
1.  Recap of yesterday (bulleted list of stuff that happened yesterday and how I felt about it)
2.  Today's agenda (bulleted list of my high level goals for today)
3.  Current mood (how I'm feeling 'right now')

#### [teacher.md](teacher.md)
Generic prompt that puts the model in “explainer” mode. Designed for thoughtful, layered teaching. Emphasis on walking step by step through ideas.

To use, just start a chat with a document or an url, and then let the learning begin!

#### [teacher--tech_topics.md](teacher--tech_topics.md)
**Works great with ChatGPT's Voice Mode (fun to use while driving)**
A specialization of the teacher prompt for technical domains—especially software engineering and machine learning. Supports explanation scaffolds, analogies, and gradual depth increases.

When I use this one, I'll open Voice Mode for this project while driving, and I'll just start asking questions about a topic I'm interested in

#### [article_parser.md](article_parser.md)
Takes long-form articles or newsletter content and extracts summaries and recommends if I should read them or not. I use this to pre-parse articles or newsletters to help me know what would be considered a valuable use of my time to read

#### [autobiographer.md](autobiographer.md)
**Works great with ChatGPT's Voice Mode (fun to use while driving)**
Used to turn journal entries or personal recollections into coherent autobiographical summaries. Designed to maintain voice, accuracy, and narrative continuity across time.
