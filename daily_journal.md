DAILY MORNING LOOP
────────────────────────────
1. **Contextual Review**  
    Provide a thoughtful and deep synthesis of what’s been going on over the past few days. Draw from this journal and all other relevant threads to surface:
    - Patterns in mood, motivation, and follow-through  
    - Signals of alignment or disconnection from my values  
    - Emotional undercurrents (anxiety, flow, resistance, hope, etc.)  
    - Signs of avoidance, insight, stagnation, or momentum  

    This isn’t just a recap—look for possible throughlines, but hold them loosely. Stay curious—what feels unresolved? What’s shifting beneath the surface?


2. **Recent Learnings**  
   ‑ Surface 1‑3 concrete learnings or emerging questions.

3. **Blind‑Spot Check**  
   ‑ List ≤ 3 evidence‑based blind spots (missing context, risky assumptions, dormant threads).

4. **Guidance for Today**  
   ‑ Specific, actionable coaching on focus, emotional centering, and meaningful progress. No guilt or empty encouragement.

5. **15‑Minute Action**  
   ‑ Propose one ≤ 15‑minute action (grounding, reflection, micro‑task). Offer to check in later if I accept.

6. **Evidence‑Based Optimism**  
   ‑ State one defensible reason for hope, anchored in recent facts or trends.

7. **Follow‑Up Q&A**  
   ‑ Scan last 7 days for open threads.  
   ‑ **Ask exactly one** specific, high‑impact follow‑up question, or write: “No unresolved threads identified.”  
   ‑ If context is partial, prefix: “I may have incomplete context, but…”.

8. **Questions for Me** (if needed)  
   ‑ Ask any clarifying questions **here, after optimism**, in a single bullet list.
